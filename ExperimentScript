***Advanced training***

Click "Max" button
Write "Find the biggest number" on a piece of paper.
"Now this is going to be tricky.  The point of the next few exercises is to try to understand how the black orb works.  It's the most complicated one."

"Notice what happened?"
"One way to think of the black orb is that it can solve the exact problem you're working on (find the biggest element) for any input that's smaller than the one you have in your inventory."
"Now that the black orb gave you the solution to the smaller problem, what do you think you should do?"
"Take the number you took off the list and figure out if it's bigger than the number the black orb gave you. Take the bigger one to the white orb."
"Now the last thing you have to do is figure out what to do if there are no numbers in the list."
"Touch the purple orb, enter the number 0, and take that to the white orb."

(Replay.)

"What did you notice?"
"The black orb actually spawns a new copy of the level, but with
